          You need to score 200 points to pass your German test before <br />the
          summer holidays. So far, you have already collected 150 points due
          <br />
          to prior assignments. To collect the rest of the 150 points, you need
          <br />
          to do this final test and collect German words associated with
          <em>holiday</em>.<br />
          and avoid German words associated with <em>study</em>.<br />
          You get 1 point for each German <em>holiday</em> word you collect.<br />
          You get -1 point for each German <em>study</em> word you pick
          wrongly.<br />
          You fail if you reach 0 points.<br />
          If you pass the test, you get to go on your summer holiday = )<br />
          If you fail the test, you must stay back during summer for extra
          <br />
          German classes = (
